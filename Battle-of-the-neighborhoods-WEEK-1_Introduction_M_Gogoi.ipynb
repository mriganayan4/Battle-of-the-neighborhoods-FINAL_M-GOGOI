It is now facing several different headwinds, including the outlook of higher taxes and a dire warning from the Bank of England that U.K. home values could fall as much as 30% in the occasion of a muddled exodus from the European Union. More precisely, four overlooked cracks advocate that the London market may be in worst shape than many apprehend: hidden price falls, record-low sales, homebuilder emigration and tax hikes addressing overseas purchasers of households in England and Wales."
